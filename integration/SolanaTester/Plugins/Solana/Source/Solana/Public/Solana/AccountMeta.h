/**
* Describes a single account read or written by a program during instruction execution.
* When constructing an Instruction, a list of all accounts that may be read or written during the execution of that instruction must
* be supplied. Any account that may be mutated by the program during execution, either its data or metadata such as held lamports,
* must be writable.
* 
* Note that because the Solana runtime schedules parallel transaction execution around which accounts are writable,
* care should be taken that only accounts which actually may be mutated are specified as writable.
